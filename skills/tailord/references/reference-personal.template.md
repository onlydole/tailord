## YOUR VOICE PATTERNS (WITH EXAMPLES)

Document the specific patterns that define your writing voice. Include
both good and bad examples showing what works and what doesn't.

### Reader solidarity
How do you open pieces? What patterns work for you?

Bad (self-focused): "[Example of an opening that doesn't work]"
Good (shared observation): "[Example of an opening that works]"

### Questions as genuine inquiry
How do you use questions in your writing?

Bad: "[Example of a rhetorical question that falls flat]"
Good: "[Example of a genuine question being explored]"

### Opening formula
What ingredients do you rotate through in your openings?
1. [First ingredient, e.g., "Reader inclusion through shared experience"]
2. [Second ingredient]
3. [Third ingredient]
4. [Fourth ingredient]

### Anti-patterns specific to your voice
- [Pattern you tend to fall into that you want to avoid]
- [Another anti-pattern]
- [Another anti-pattern]

## LEARNINGS FROM EDITORIAL SESSIONS

This section is populated automatically by the learning capture step
(Step 6 in SKILL.md / LEARNING CAPTURE in editorial.md) after each
editorial session. You can also add entries manually.

Each entry should include:
- A ### heading naming the pattern
- A bad example (the original text)
- What was wrong (one sentence)
- The fix that worked (the revised text)
- The date and piece title for context

### Never fabricate atmospheric details
[Will be populated from editorial sessions where the AI invented
vivid details that weren't sourced.]

### Credentials illuminate when they show work
[Will be populated from editorial sessions where credential-stuffing
was caught vs. showing what someone built.]

### Real errors caught by editorial agents
[Will be populated from editorial sessions where factual errors
were caught and corrected. Track the agent's false-positive rate
here — it's lower than you think.]

## NARRATIVE FLOW PATTERNS (FROM PUBLISHED WORK)

Extract structural patterns from your own published pieces.

### The thematic thread
[Describe how you connect multiple topics with a single theme. Include
an example from a published piece.]

### The non-repeating callback
[Describe how you reference earlier material in ways that advance the
narrative rather than restating it.]

### Section endings that create forward momentum
[Describe how you end sections to keep readers moving forward.]

### Concern consolidation
[Describe how you assign related concerns to specific sections instead
of scattering them.]

## EDITORIAL LEARNINGS (CONTENT-TYPE SPECIFIC)

Document patterns you've noticed in specific content types.

### Tutorial-style duplication
[How do you handle the overview-vs-steps tension in tutorial posts?]

### Tonal transition management
[How do you bridge between strategic and tactical sections?]
